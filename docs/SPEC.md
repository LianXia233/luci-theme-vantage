# Vantage — v1 specification

Status: **draft for approval**. Nothing here is built yet except the dev
tooling in `dev/`.

Vantage is a LuCI theme plus a companion dashboard app for OpenWrt. It
takes its cues from the *functionality* of managed-network consoles —
seeing the whole network at a glance, drilling into any client, radio or
port in one click, finding anything by typing — not from their look.

## 1. Goals

1. Every stock LuCI page works and looks deliberate under Vantage: no
   unstyled widget, no broken dropdown, no stuck spinner (see
   `docs/luci-contract.md`).
2. Navigation is fast: any page is two clicks or one Ctrl+K away.
3. The dashboard answers "is my network OK, and if not, where?" within a
   glance, on real devices with real quirks (APs without DHCP, missing
   noise values, placeholder model strings).
4. Safe by construction: app in v1 writes only its own config, narrow ACLs, template and
   DOM security checks in CI.
5. Small and offline: no CDNs, no web fonts, no frameworks, works on a
   128 MB device, first paint under 1 s on the device's own web server.

### Non-goals (v1)

- Replacing LuCI's forms or views; Vantage styles and wraps them.
- Device-changing actions from the dashboard (v2, behind their own ACLs).
- History/graphs (v2 plugin), topology maps (later).
- 24.10 support (after 25.12 is solid; contract differences are unverified).

## 2. Packages

| Package | Contents | Depends |
|---|---|---|
| `luci-theme-vantage` | ucode templates, CSS, icons, `menu-vantage.js` (shell: rail, top bar, palette, tabs, indicators), login page | `+luci-base` |
| `luci-app-vantage` | dashboard + inspector views under `admin/dashboard` (landing page), its rpcd ACL (reads + its own config only), its rpcd ucode plugin `luci.vantage` (key-free wireless status, validated alias writes), `/etc/config/vantage` | `+luci-base +rpcd +rpcd-mod-iwinfo +rpcd-mod-ucode +ucode-mod-uci +ucode-mod-ubus` (all but rpcd-mod-iwinfo come with luci-base); reverse DNS (`rpcd-mod-rrdns`), mDNS (`umdns`) and hostapd's ubus objects are optional and degrade |

The theme is useful alone; the app works under any theme but is designed
for Vantage. Names used everywhere: theme dir `vantage`, media URL
`/luci-static/vantage`, uci `luci.themes.Vantage`, config `/etc/config/vantage`.

## 3. Theme v1

### Shell

- **Icon rail** (left, 56 px) with the top-level categories from
  `ui.menu`; hover/click opens a **flyout** of that category's pages;
  the rail can be pinned open with labels (remembered per browser).
- **Top bar**: breadcrumb (Category › Page › Tab), **command palette**
  (Ctrl+K or `/`): fuzzy search over every menu page, recent pages first;
  later the app registers entities (clients, interfaces, radios) into it.
- **Indicators** as pills; the unsaved-changes count is prominent and
  opens the changes dialog.
- **Host chip**: hostname · model (board name when the model string is a
  placeholder), from `system board` via rpc in the menu script.
- **Theme toggle**: auto / light / dark, stored in `localStorage`, applied
  in `<head>` before CSS (no flash), exposed as `html[data-darkmode]`.
- **Tabs** (depth ≥ 3) under the top bar, underlined. Each tab level
  inside a page has one look, and a page has one underline strip: on a
  page without menu tabs, tabs standing at page level (Interfaces /
  Devices / ..., Channel Analysis's radios) are its sub-pages and take
  the underline; the first level inside a page, form or modal is a
  segmented control; tabs inside a tab are a side list where the pane is
  wide enough and chips where it is not, and at any deeper level.
- **Mobile** (≤ 720 px): rail becomes a drawer/bottom bar, tables become
  cards using `td[data-title]`, forms stack.

### Pages

- Own **login** (`sysauth.ut`): brand, hostname, generic error, contract-
  correct form. No system information for unauthenticated visitors.
- All core widgets per contract §5 (dropdown state machine, tabs, modals
  incl. apply countdown, tooltips, dynlist, progress bars, file browser,
  notifications with real fade-out transition, changes dialog).
- **Forms**: one control height for inputs, selects, dropdowns, buttons
  and tabs, chosen by pointer type, not screen width (36 px with a mouse,
  44 px on touch, 16 px text in touch fields); a 180 px label column and
  fields up to 360 px (a select grows to fit a long choice). Field help,
  and page and section intros, show their first line and an (i) button
  unfolds the rest, so the start of a warning is always visible; text
  that fits one line gets no button. A page or card heading that only
  repeats the breadcrumb, the map title or its tab is hidden visually and
  kept for screen readers. LuCI's text and the order of LuCI's nodes are
  never changed: the menu script adds the (i) buttons (after a field
  row's field, or first inside an intro) and sets classes, `data-v-help`
  and (where missing) a description `id` for `aria-controls`.
- 404 / CSRF pages render in the theme without leaking anything.

### Visual identity

**Chosen: Graphite** (2026-09-26). Paper stays in `prototypes/paper` as a
reference only.

- **Graphite** — dark-first technical console, graphite neutrals,
  signal-lime accent, monospace tabular values, compact.
- **Paper** — light-first editorial, warm paper neutrals, vermilion
  accent, typography-led, softer.

Either way: one accent colour only, status colours distinct from it,
system font stacks, self-drawn SVG icons, WCAG AA contrast in both modes,
visible focus, reduced-motion respected.

One type scale for the theme and the dashboard: 10.5 / 12 / 13 / 14 /
16 / 20 / 24 px (`--fs-*`, shared as `--v-fs-*`). Every font size comes
from it, except the 16 px of fields on touch screens (iOS zooms into
anything smaller); monospace text is set a few percent smaller than the
text around it so it looks the same size.

## 4. App v1 (`luci-app-vantage`)

- **Overview**: device card (model, firmware, uptime, CPU, memory, temp
  if available), uplink card (resolved uplink interface, address, rate),
  radios card (band, channel, width, tx power, utilisation, client count),
  clients card (count by band, weakest signals), health score.
- **Inspectors** (drawer or page, deep-linkable):
  client (MAC, host hint, IP, radio/SSID, signal history for the session,
  rates, inactive time), radio (channel, width, noise when real, clients),
  interface (proto, addresses, counters, rates).
- **Client names**: every client gets a human label, resolved in order:
  user alias (rename in the inspector, stored in `/etc/config/vantage`),
  reverse DNS (`network.rrdns`, optional grant), DHCP host name from host
  hints, mDNS (`umdns`, when running; unauthenticated, so only below DNS
  and DHCP and only when uncontested: an address claimed by two names, or
  a name that would land on two stations, is not used), WPS device name,
  vendor from a small built-in OUI table, or "Private Wi-Fi address" for
  randomised MACs. Never "?". The source is shown.
- **Insight over decoration**: per-client experience score with a reason,
  Wi-Fi generation badges and legacy-client flags, top talkers by live
  throughput, new/recently-gone clients, busiest radio; each insight links
  to the LuCI page that fixes it.
- **Entity search**: clients, interfaces, radios, SSIDs injected into the
  command palette.
- **Health**: simple, explainable scores (e.g. signal < −75 dBm, uplink
  down, memory > 90 %, radio disabled) each with a one-line reason and a
  link to the page that fixes it.
- **Layout**: tiles are packed into columns (four, two or one by width);
  each tile has a column, a width and a place in the order, and stacks
  under the earlier tiles in its columns. "Layout" lets the viewer drag
  tiles, move them with buttons or arrow keys, change their width within
  a per-tile minimum and hide them. Saved in `localStorage` per screen
  class (and separately for wired devices), validated on read; never on
  the device.
- **Controls** (buttons, filter, chips, sort headers, icon buttons) take
  the theme's control height through `--v-ctl-h` (36 px, 44 px on
  touch) and the theme's control radius (`--v-r`); under another theme
  the app falls back to the same 36/44 px by pointer type. Text sizes come
  from the theme's type scale (`--v-fs-*`). The layout itself stays the
  app's own: container queries on its own width, one column below
  700 px. On a 721–803 px screen the dashboard is therefore still one
  column while theme forms already sit beside their labels; that is
  intended, since the dashboard only gets about 600–700 px there and its
  two-column tiles clip below that (measured).
- Polling via `poll.add` with sane intervals; pauses when the tab is hidden.
- ACL: three groups. `luci-app-vantage` (read): `system info/board`,
  `network.interface dump`, `network.device status`, `iwinfo
  info/assoclist`, `hostapd.* get_status/get_clients`, `luci-rpc
  getHostHints`, `luci.vantage wireless`, `umdns hosts`, `file read` of
  `/proc/stat`, `uci get` for `vantage`; no `file.exec`.
  `luci-app-vantage-rdns` (read, optional): `network.rrdns lookup`, kept
  apart because its caller chooses the DNS server and port; the view
  checks the grant and skips reverse DNS without it.
  `luci-app-vantage-names` (write): `luci.vantage set_alias` only; no
  group grants uci writes.
- rpcd ucode plugin `luci.vantage` (`/usr/share/rpcd/ucode/luci.vantage`):
  `wireless` returns `network.wireless status` reduced to the fields the
  view reads (no `key`, `sae_password`, RADIUS or 802.11r secrets, no EAP
  credentials; `encryption` only as the mode string); per-interface BSSID
  and SSID come from `iwinfo info`. `set_alias({mac, name, icon})`
  re-applies the view's rules on the device (unicast MAC, name of at most
  48 code points without control, bidi or invisible characters, icon from
  the fixed list), keeps one section per MAC, refuses a new name past 512,
  and writes and commits config `vantage` only.

## 5. Later

- **v2**: one-click actions (restart radio, kick/ban client, toggle SSID)
  each behind a separate narrow write ACL and a confirmation;
  optional rpcd plugin keeping a small ring buffer for history, alerts.
- **v3**: topology view, luci-app-statistics integration, 24.10 support.

## 6. Security requirements

- Templates escape everything request-derived; never echo `fuser`; the
  theme's own markup for unauthenticated renders (login, 404, CSRF) adds
  nothing about the device. Not in the theme's control: LuCI's core
  `header.ut` prints `L = new LuCI({...})` after the theme header on every
  page, with the LuCI build and package-database time in the `luci.js`
  URL and `nodespec: dispatched`, which on an anonymous 404 is the whole
  menu tree (modules, view paths, ACL group names, `depends`). Only a
  luci-base change can fix that (see `docs/luci-contract.md` section 2);
  `test_templates.js` renders the core 404 around the theme and tracks it
  as a known upstream failure.
- No `innerHTML`/`insertAdjacentHTML`/string-built DOM with data; `E()`
  and text nodes only; style, selectors, dynamic regular expressions and
  history URLs from data are rejected too (checked by
  `security-tests/check_dom_sinks.js`, on the theme and the app, with no
  `dom-safe` suppressions).
- ACL test: the app's ACL grants only the listed read methods and every
  `rpc.declare` in the app is covered, nothing unused is granted
  (`security-tests/test_acl_policy.js`, also run by `node --test tests/`).
  The one object glob is `hostapd.*` (hostapd's ubus objects are named per
  interface), limited to `get_clients`/`get_status`. No group grants a uci
  write or reads Wi-Fi keys; the only write is the plugin's `set_alias`,
  whose validation `tests/plugin.test.js` checks against the view's.
- No private addresses or MACs in committed files
  (`security-tests/check_private_addresses.js`, which also looks for the
  hostnames/SSIDs recorded in the mirror when it is present); fixtures are
  pseudonymised from the mirror (MAC → 00:00:5E:00:53:xx, IPv4 →
  192.0.2.x/198.51.100.x, IPv6 → 2001:db8::/32, hostnames → client-NN).
  Invented locally administered MACs use the 02:00:5E:xx:xx:xx prefix
  (IANA OUI with the U/L bit set; e.g. the replay's synthetic BSSIDs);
  no other MACs pass.
- Built-package verification (`security-tests/verify_built_apk.js`, run by
  `dev/build/sdk-build.sh` before anything reaches `dist/`) and a
  reproducible release manifest (`dist/<release>/BUILDINFO`: commit, SDK
  image digest, SDK tarball hash, entrypoint hash, feed commits).

## 7. Development workflow

- `dev/mirror/`: read-only recorders (browser + SSH). Private data stays in
  `~/Work/vantage-mirror` (mode 0700), never in the repo.
- `dev/replay/`: offline LuCI served from the mirror; `--theme-dir` loads
  the theme from the working tree, reload to see edits.
- Tests: node unit tests for data logic, headless screenshot suite over a
  fixed page list (light/dark/mobile) for visual review.
- Build: OpenWrt SDK 25.12 in podman, same reproducible pipeline as before.
- Deploy to the AP only when explicitly asked; the AP stays on its current
  theme until Vantage is approved.

## 8. Decisions needed

1. ~~Visual direction~~ — decided: Graphite.
2. Mobile nav: bottom bar vs drawer (prototypes may show both).
3. Anything to add or cut from theme v1 / app v1 above.
